/*
1. Write a std::vector<vector<State>> Search function stub which takes a board grid and two arrays of size 2 as arguments. 
   The int arrays will represent the start and goal coordinates for the search. 
2. The function should print ""No path found!" and return an empty std::vector<vector<State>>. 
3. The function will later return the board with a path from the start to the goal.
4. In main(), call Search with a start of {0, 0} and a goal of {4, 5}. Store the results in the variable solution.
5. Pass solution to PrintBoard.
